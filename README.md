# Computercraft-utils
## A repository for common things AND integrations with various mods (such as Extreme Reactors and stargate) - intended for ATM9 (mc 1.20.1)

## Intention: GUI Utilities and APIs

My plan is to add utilities and common tools that shouldn't need copy-pasting everywhere

-- **Frames**: Simple top-level panels that should serve as common parent of all elements beneath
- **Buttons**: Easy-to-use buttons with different styles and states.
- **Panels**: Customizable panels for grouping UI elements.
- **Utils**: General tools for drawing shapes, handling inputs, and updating screens.
- **APIs**: Simple and intuitive APIs for creating and managing GUI components.
- **Peripheral integration**: Builtin monitor things (Advanceed monitor, of course)

My main plan is to have a management screen and input for reactors, stargates and remote redstone stuff.
